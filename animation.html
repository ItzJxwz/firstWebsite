            <h2>Software: Adobe After Effects.</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to do a short film done in after effects based on the safety of driving. I wanted to do this
                through entertainment, so I tried to do this in a comedic aspect. I used the funny audios from
                “freesounds.org” . I chose these colors and shapes being that red and black are my two favorite colors,
                and I used the rectangles to represent the window and the body of the vehicle. The most challenging part
                of this project was figuring out HOW I was going to animate this. I didn’t know where to start. I had
                about two drafts prior to this one. In terms of timing, I had to use after effects on the campus, being
                that my computer wasn’t allowing me to use it at home, so I never got to finish the project on time.
                But... Here it is!!
